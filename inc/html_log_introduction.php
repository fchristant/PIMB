<h1>Using the log</h1>
<p>This page allows you to 
inspect log files. You can inspect a log by selecting it from the dropdown list and then
clicking on "View log". You can either select an individual bot log file or the generic PIMB
error log file. <br/><br/>The bot log files will list events and messages that were received by your bot
while the <a href="viewlog.php?file=">general error log</a> file lists errors that occured in the PIMB bot engine.<br/><br/>
The log panel will list the last 25 messages of the log by default, in descending order. When a new bot event occurs, i.e. a user
sends a message to your bot, the panel will be updated in real-time. Using the play and pause buttons, the realtime feature can 
be started (play) or stopped (pause).<br/><br/>
To clear the log file from the server, select the bot, and then choose "Clear log". To return to the main administration 
page, choose "Back to main".
